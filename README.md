"# cs430p2" 
This is a program that raycasts an image by first parsing a JSON file and getting the image data
out of it, it then converts the data for sphere/camera/plane, and does intersections from 
the origin +1 on the z and then the raycast creates the pixel data for r,g,b at what position and what intensity
I did not fully complete this as I ran out of time, had 4-5 other homeworks due on monday or today and
just ran out of time, I know i should have started even earlier but I thought what I had done was
enough to where I wouldn't run out of time but I had got confused on the raycasting part on how the vectors
work within the for loops which took awhile. I also was not sure how to do a makefile as I did not
realize I needed to make one until it was a little too late. I hopefully will not get as swamped with assignments
on the next one and I will definitely start early this time.
